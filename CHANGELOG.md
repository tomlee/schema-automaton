# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is loosely
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); this project is
**alpha** and the public API may still change between releases.

## [v0.2.18] — Consistency audit, validation error codes, 100% coverage restored

Closes out the schema-operations initiative with a sweep pass
(issue [#143](https://github.com/omnist-dev/omnist/issues/143)):

- **Added:** every validation `Error` now carries a stable machine-readable
  `code` (`unexpected-field`, `cardinality`, `type-mismatch`,
  `null-not-allowed`, `shape-mismatch`) alongside `path` and `message` —
  match on `.code`, not message text, when reacting programmatically.
  `str(ValidationResult)` output is unchanged.
- **Changed:** docs/docstrings audited for wording that predated the
  initiative — `normalize` is consistently described as the canonical
  minimal form (partition refinement), not "merge structurally-identical
  records"; `docs/design/model.md` gains a paper-correspondence table
  mapping every operation to its algorithm in Lee & Cheung (CIKM 2010).
- **Fixed:** the 100% coverage target is true again — `deserialize.py` and
  `cli.py` had silently drifted to 97%; real tests now cover the drifted
  lines, with `# pragma: no cover` used only for annotated, genuinely
  unreachable defensive guards. The coverage snapshot in `docs/testing.md`
  is regenerated from an actual run (previously had invented/stale counts).

## [v0.2.17] — Subschema extraction (#142)

**Added:** `Schema.extract(*labels)` / `omnist.canonical.ops.extract.extract(schema, keep)`,
implementing the paper's Algorithm 5 (ExtractSubschema) -- given a
permissible label set, produces the minimal subschema that only recognizes
documents built from those labels. This is the paper's headline
application: trimming a large shared schema (xCBL, in the paper) down to
just what a single document type needs. Fields whose label isn't kept are
deleted; deleting a *mandatory* (`min >= 1`) field invalidates the record
that had it, invalidation propagates transitively through mandatory refs,
and if the root itself is invalidated `extract` raises `SchemaError`
naming the first offending label and record rather than silently loosening
cardinality (a deliberate design decision -- see `ops/extract.py`'s
docstring). The result is `prune()`d and `normalize()`d before being
returned, same as Algorithm 5's own final MakeUseful + Minimize step. New
CLI subcommand: `omnist schema extract SCHEMA_FILE --keep label1,label2,...`
(`--compact`/`-o` supported like `schema format`/`schema normalize`;
mandatory-deletion failure is a definite "no" -- stderr + exit 1, not the
generic exit 2 for parse/usage errors).

## [v0.2.16] — Internal equivalence oracle + property suite (#141)

**Added:** an internal, non-public second decision procedure for schema
equivalence, `omnist.canonical.ops.isomorphic._isomorphic`, implementing
the paper's Algorithm 3 step 3 (isomorphism testing between two already-
normalized schemas). This gives `equivalent()` (bidirectional
`compatible_with`, Algorithm 4) an algorithm-independent oracle: the
paper's Theorem 4 says two schemas are equivalent iff their minimized
forms are isomorphic, and a new Hypothesis property suite in
`tests/test_fuzz.py` asserts the two procedures always agree, both on
random pairs and on pairs deliberately constructed to be equivalent
(rename, field reorder, added unreachable record, added `max == 0`
field). `_isomorphic` is not exported from `omnist` or
`omnist.canonical` -- `equivalent()` stays the cheaper, single public
algorithm; the second one exists purely as a testing oracle. See
`docs/testing.md` for the "dual-algorithm oracle" writeup.

## [v0.2.15] — Rewrite `normalize()` as partition-refinement minimization (canonical minimal form)

**Changed (behavior-affecting):** `Schema.normalize()` was a single
syntactic merge pass keyed by full structural identity (including ref
target names) -- neither minimal nor canonical, and violated its own
contract (a ref-chained pair of duplicate records only merged after a
*second* `normalize()` call; mutually-recursive "twin" records that are
genuinely `equivalent()` never merged at all, no matter how many times you
called it). `normalize()` is now the paper's Algorithm 2 (MinimizeSA):
partition refinement, the same family of algorithm as DFA minimization.
It prunes first (`Schema.prune()`, added in v0.2.14), partitions env
records by a target-blind local signature, then repeatedly splits blocks
apart wherever a same-labeled ref field points at a still-distinguishable
target, until stable -- producing the canonical **minimal** equivalent
schema (fewest env records), unique up to record naming.

This changes observable output in three ways:
- **Unreachable records are now dropped** (previously survived --
  `normalize()` never looked at reachability).
- **Ref-chained duplicates merge in one call**, and **mutually-recursive
  twin records now merge** when truly equivalent (previously never did).
- **`max == 0` fields and optional-but-unsatisfiable fields disappear**,
  via the new mandatory `prune()` step.

**Design decision:** the initial partition (`local_signature`,
`ops/signature.py`) sorts a record's fields by label rather than keeping
declaration order, since `Record` validation is order-independent --
two records with the same fields in a different order now correctly
merge (previously they were structurally distinct and never did).

See [model spec §13](docs/design/model.md#13-minimization-and-canonical-form)
for the full `normalize()` <-> MinimizeSA correspondence.

## [v0.2.14] — Fix `compatible_with`/`equivalent` for empty-language schemas; add `Schema.prune()`/`Schema.is_empty()`

**Fixed:** a schema with a mandatory ref cycle (e.g. `record A { "x": B }
record B { "y": A } root A`) accepts no finite document -- the empty
language -- but `compatible_with`/`equivalent` gave wrong answers for it:
an empty schema was reported as *not* `compatible_with` anything, and two
distinct empty schemas were reported as *not* `equivalent`, when both are
vacuously true (a schema that emits no documents is trivially a subschema
of any other schema). Root cause: the paper's Algorithm 4 (SubschemaSA)
assumes its precondition MakeUsefulSA (useless-state removal) has already
run; omnist's `_sub` ran the coinductive cycle rule without it, so an
unsatisfiable record's self-matching cycle was read as "compatible with
nothing" instead of "vacuously compatible with everything."

Adds `omnist/canonical/ops/prune.py`: `satisfiable_set(s)` (least-fixpoint
satisfiability -- a record is satisfiable iff every mandatory field is a
`Scalar` or a `Ref` to a satisfiable record), plus two new public
operations, `Schema.is_empty()` (True iff the root is unsatisfiable) and
`Schema.prune()` (the paper's MakeUsefulSA analog -- an equivalent schema
with unreachable records, never-emittable `max == 0` fields, and
optional-but-unsatisfiable fields removed; the root's own fields are left
untouched when the root itself is unsatisfiable, since pruning them would
silently produce a different, satisfiable schema). `ops/subschema.py` now
computes the A-side's satisfiable set once per `compatible_with` call,
returns vacuously `True` for an unsatisfiable A-side record, skips optional
A-fields whose type is unsatisfiable, and replaces the per-path `seen` set
with a shared memo dict (coinductive assumption on entry, real result
before returning) to avoid exponential re-verification on DAG-shaped
schemas.

See issue [#139](https://github.com/omnist-dev/omnist/issues/139).

## [v0.2.13] — Internal refactor: operations package groundwork

Internal refactoring with zero behavior change (full test suite passes
untouched). `omnist/canonical/operations.py` is now an `ops/` package with
three modules (subschema/minimize/signature), each implementing one algorithm
from the Lee & Cheung paper. Additionally, `Schema.resolve()` is simplified
to a single dictionary lookup (guaranteed by `check_refs()` that env values
are always Records), and `Record.field()` is now O(1) via a label index
built during `__init__`. Groundwork for follow-up correctness initiatives
(prune/is_empty, minimize rewrite, oracle, extract).
See issue [#138](https://github.com/omnist-dev/omnist/issues/138).

## [v0.2.12] — Docs: equivalent and normalize in schema reference

Added full examples for `Schema.equivalent()` and `Schema.normalize()` to
`docs/schema.md#operations-compare-and-infer`. Both operations were already
implemented and tested, but only mentioned in a cross-reference. The section
now shows them alongside `compatible_with` and `infer` with self-contained
code snippets. Backed by new assertions in `tests/test_docs.py`.
See issue [#136](https://github.com/omnist-dev/omnist/issues/136).

## [v0.2.11] — Compact (single-line) output for OML and OSD

`write_oml(node, indent=None)` and `to_osd(schema, indent=None)` (also
`Schema.to_osd(indent=None)`) now render single-line, machine-oriented
output instead of the pretty-printed default — `indent=None` mirrors
`write_json`'s existing convention. Both compact forms round-trip through
the unchanged `read_oml`/`parse_schema`, since OML already treats `;` as
an edge separator and OSD already treats whitespace as insignificant.

The CLI gains a `--compact` flag on every command that writes OML or OSD
text: `format`, `convert` (when `--to oml`), `infer`, `schema format`,
`schema normalize`. Purely additive — all defaults are unchanged. See
issue [#133](https://github.com/omnist-dev/omnist/issues/133).

## [v0.2.10] — Rename `to_dsl`/`dsl.py` to `to_osd`/`osd.py` (Breaking)

`to_dsl()` and `Schema.to_dsl()` are renamed to `to_osd()`/`Schema.to_osd()`,
and `omnist/canonical/dsl.py` is renamed to `omnist/canonical/osd.py`. This
finishes the OSD (Omnist Schema Definition) terminology rewrite — `to_dsl`
was the one writer left following the old name instead of the `to_<format>`
pattern every other writer uses (`to_oml`, `to_json`, …). No deprecated
alias is provided, consistent with this project's practice of clean breaks
over shims (e.g. `obj`/`arr`/`ObjectType` before it).

## [v0.2.9] — `omnist --version`

Adds `omnist --version` (prints `<prog> <version>`, exit `0`) and a
one-line `description=` on the top-level parser, so `omnist --help`
explains what the tool is before listing subcommands.

## [v0.2.8] — `omnist convert --strict`/`--report`, `omnist check`

Completes the CLI implementation arc (see `docs/design/cli-spec.md`) —
`omnist --help` now matches the spec exactly.

- `omnist convert` gains `--strict`, `--report`, and `--result-format
  text|json|oml`, mapping directly to `write_<to>`'s existing `strict=`/
  `report=` parameters:
  - `--report` prints what got adjusted to stderr (encoded per
    `--result-format`); the write still happens.
  - `--strict` refuses to write at all if anything would need adjusting
    — exit `1` (a definite "no," grouped with `validate`/`compatible-with`,
    not with the usage/parse failures that exit `2`).
- New `omnist check <input> --from FMT --to FMT [--strict]
  [--result-format text|json|oml]` — reports what `write_<to>` would
  adjust without ever writing. Unlike `convert`, `--from`/`--to` may be
  equal. Default: always exits `0` (purely informational); `--strict`
  turns it into a `0`/`1` CI gate.
- Added a CLI-level crash-freedom fuzz test (arbitrary/malformed input
  across every command/format combination must always exit cleanly,
  never raise an uncaught exception) — the codecs themselves are already
  fuzzed by `tests/test_fuzz.py`; this only covers the CLI's own
  error-surfacing path.

## [v0.2.7] — `omnist convert` (core)

Adds `omnist convert <input> --from FMT --to FMT [--schema FILE] [-o
OUTPUT]` (see `docs/design/cli-spec.md`) — the core cross-format
conversion command:

- `--from oml --to oml` is rejected (exit `2`, points at `omnist format`
  instead, which already covers that case losslessly). Every other
  same-format pair (`json`→`json`, etc.) is allowed, since there's no
  replacement command for those.
- `--schema FILE` upgrades/validates the input on read per the
  [deserialization guarantee](docs/deserialization.md); a conformance
  failure raises `ParseError` (every problem found), nothing written,
  exit `2`.
- One document in, one document out, following the library's
  single-rooted Document constraint (most visible in XML's one-root
  requirement) — no batch mode.

`--strict`/`--report`/`--result-format` (the adjustment-reporting flags)
land in a follow-up release.

## [v0.2.6] — `omnist infer`

Adds `omnist infer <input>... --from FMT [-o OUTPUT]` (see
`docs/design/cli-spec.md`). All inputs must be the same format; each is
read as a `Doc`, `infer(docs)` drafts a schema from them, written out as
OSD.

## [v0.2.5] — `omnist schema normalize`/`compatible-with`/`equivalent`

Adds three more schema CLI commands (see `docs/design/cli-spec.md`):

- `omnist schema normalize <schema-file> [-o OUTPUT]` — `Schema.normalize()`,
  written back as OSD (may merge structurally-identical records, unlike
  `schema format`).
- `omnist schema compatible-with <a> <b> [--result-format text|json|oml]`
  — `a.compatible_with(b)`.
- `omnist schema equivalent <a> <b> [--result-format text|json|oml]` —
  `a.equivalent(b)`.

The latter two print `true`/`false` (`text`, default), `{"compatible":
bool}`/`{"equivalent": bool}` (`json`), or the same shape OML-encoded
(`oml`); exit `0` if true, `1` if false.

## [v0.2.4] — `omnist validate`

Adds `omnist validate <input> --from FMT --schema FILE [--result-format
text|json|oml]` (see `docs/design/cli-spec.md`). Reads the input
**without** schema-directed upgrading (mirroring the library's own
validation/deserialization split) and runs `Schema.validate`:

- `text` (default): `ValidationResult`'s own `"invalid:\n  at $.path:
  message"` formatting, or `valid`.
- `json`/`oml`: `{ok, errors}`, structurally identical either way.

Exit `0` if valid, `1` if invalid, `2` on a read/parse error.

## [v0.2.3] — first CLI commands: `omnist format` / `omnist schema format`

Adds the `omnist` command-line tool (first two commands of a multi-PR
rollout; see `docs/design/cli-spec.md` for the full planned surface):

- `omnist format <input> [-o OUTPUT]` — canonicalize an OML document
  (`read_oml` → `write_oml`). `-` for stdin, omit `-o` for stdout.
- `omnist schema format <schema-file> [-o OUTPUT]` — canonicalize an OSD
  schema file (`parse_schema` → `to_dsl`), a safe reformat only (no
  structural change).

Both commands map directly onto the existing public API with no new
behavior; malformed input raises the library's own `ParseError`/
`SchemaError`, printed cleanly to stderr with exit code `2`, never an
uncaught traceback.

## [v0.2.2] — schema-directed deserialization now guarantees conformance (BREAKING)

**Breaking:** `materialize()` (and `schema=` on every reader / `Doc.from_*`)
now raises `ParseError` for shape problems too — an unexpected field, a
missing field, the wrong cardinality, a record where a scalar was expected
or vice versa — not just scalar conversions that aren't value-exact. There's
no `strict=` flag: passing a schema is itself the request for a
guaranteed-conforming Document, so this is now the only behavior once a
schema is given; `schema=None` remains the unchanged way to opt out of any
checking. All problems found in one deserialization (scalar *and* shape) are
collected and raised together in a single `ParseError`, rather than failing
on only the first one encountered.

Previously, `materialize` only checked/converted scalar leaves and silently
passed shape mismatches through unchanged, leaving them to a separate,
explicit `schema.validate(doc)` call — see issue
[#115](https://github.com/omnist-dev/omnist/issues/115). That split meant
code passing `schema=` to a reader could still get back a Document that
didn't actually conform to it, without anything raising. `materialize` now
performs validation and upgrading together in one recursive pass (it
doesn't call `Schema.validate` after the fact — that would be a second,
redundant top-down walk with no notion of upgrading); `Schema.validate`
itself is unchanged and still useful for validating a Document you didn't
just deserialize.

If you relied on the old passthrough behavior, switch to reading without
`schema=` (untouched node, no checking at all) and call
`schema.validate(doc(...))` yourself when you want to check shape without
upgrading scalars.

## [v0.2.1] — moved to the omnist-dev GitHub organization

No code changes. The repository moved from `github.com/tomlee/omnist` to
`github.com/omnist-dev/omnist` (the old URL redirects automatically). Updated
every current reference to the new path: `pyproject.toml`'s project URLs,
`mkdocs.yml`'s `repo_url`/`repo_name`, the absolute GitHub links to source
files added in the OML/Schema DSL grammar docs and the glossary, the GitHub
Pages link (now `omnist-dev.github.io/omnist`), and `CONTRIBUTING.md`/
`SECURITY.md`'s clone/issue links. The historical CHANGELOG entry about the
earlier `dataspec` → `omnist` rename (v0.1.1a8) is left as written, since it
describes what was true at the time.

## [v0.2.0] — first PyPI release

No code changes since v0.1.9 — this is a milestone version bump marking the
first release published to PyPI, after the documentation/test-hardening
arc since v0.1.2: OML (the native lossless format, v0.1.3), four
fuzz-discovered correctness fixes across XML/YAML/OML (v0.1.4, v0.1.6-9),
order-independent `infer()` (v0.1.3), 100% line coverage, property-based
fuzz testing, and a full documentation pass (formal grammars for OML and
the Schema DSL, a glossary, a dedicated schema-directed-deserialization
page, per-format reading/writing reference sections, and diagrams for the
Document model, the Schema model, and the format-conversion flow).

## [v0.1.9]

- Fix: an XML element label containing a trailing or embedded newline (e.g.
  `'A\n'`) was silently treated as a valid XML name and written verbatim by
  `write_xml`, with `check_xml` reporting no adjustment -- but XML element
  names can't legally contain whitespace, so the newline was actually
  stripped on `read_xml`'s round-trip, losing data without warning. Root
  cause: `_XML_NAME`'s regex anchored its end with a bare `$`, which in
  Python matches either at the absolute end of the string *or* just before
  a trailing `\n` -- so `'A\n'` was incorrectly accepted as already valid.
  Anchored with `\Z` instead, so any label containing a newline (or other
  non-XML-name character) anywhere now correctly falls through to the
  existing `key.sanitized` adjustment path, the same one used for other
  illegal-XML-name labels, and round-trips losslessly via the sanitized
  name. Found by the fuzz suite. (#95)

## [v0.1.8]

- Fix: `write_xml` wrote string leaf values into element text verbatim, so a
  string containing a C0 control character that XML 1.0 forbids (e.g. `\x00`,
  `\x08`, `\x0b`, `\x0c`, `\x1f`, or a UTF-16 surrogate) produced text that
  wasn't well-formed XML -- `read_xml` would then fail to parse the writer's
  own output, and `check_xml` gave no advance warning. `check_xml`/`write_xml`
  now detect this and report a new adjustment code, `string.illegal_xml_char`
  (`"error"` severity); `write_xml` replaces each illegal character with
  U+FFFD so the output is always well-formed (`strict=True` raises instead).
  Separately, a literal `\r` survives `write_xml` as a raw CR byte, but XML's
  mandated line-ending normalization on parse turns it into `\n` -- this was
  already legal XML (not a bug) but undocumented lossiness; it's now reported
  via a new `string.cr_normalized` adjustment code (`"warning"` severity).
  Found by the fuzz suite (#64). Documented in `docs/api.md` and
  `docs/formats/xml.md`. (#67)

## [v0.1.7]

- Fix: a string used as a field label or scalar value containing U+0085
  (NEL, "next line") silently came back as a plain space after a
  `write_yaml`/`read_yaml` round-trip, with `check_yaml` reporting no
  adjustment — undocumented data loss. Root cause: PyYAML's emitter/parser
  treat U+0085 as a line-break character under the default plain/
  single-quoted scalar styles and normalize it away; U+2028/U+2029 are
  unaffected. Forcing PyYAML's double-quoted scalar style for any string
  containing U+0085 round-trips it correctly (confirmed both globally and
  per-scalar), so `write_yaml` now does this automatically via a custom
  string representer, and `check_yaml`/`write_yaml` report it with the new
  `string.line-break-char` adjustment code. (#69)

## [v0.1.6]

- Fix: an internal node with zero edges (`[]`) and a leaf holding the empty
  string (`''`) both serialize to the same XML element, `<tag />`, so
  `read_xml` couldn't tell them apart and always reconstructed the
  empty-string leaf -- a documented-but-previously-undetected round-trip
  ambiguity found by the fuzz suite (#64). `check_xml`/`write_xml` now
  report a new adjustment code, `shape.empty_ambiguous`, when writing an
  empty internal node, since that's the direction that's actually lossy
  (writing an empty-string leaf round-trips fine and is not flagged).
  Documented in `docs/api.md` and `docs/formats/xml.md`. (#68)

## [v0.1.5]

- Fix: `tests/test_fuzz.py::test_doc_and_build_node_round_trip_from_plain_python_value`
  compared two structures that could contain a bare `nan` scalar with plain
  `==`, which fails for any float `nan` (`nan != nan` in Python) even though
  the round-trip itself is correct — a deterministic test failure whenever
  Hypothesis happened to generate a NaN value, found immediately after the
  fuzz-test PR (#73) landed. Fixed by using the suite's existing
  `nan_safe_equal` helper for this comparison too, matching how the
  adjacent OML round-trip assertion in the same test already handled it.
  No library behavior changed — test-only fix. (#75)

## [v0.1.4]

- Fix: `write_oml` wrote the labels `"inf"` and `"nan"` as bare (unquoted)
  identifiers, but the scanner tokenizes these spellings as `NUMBER`
  literals (higher priority than `IDENT`), so `read_oml` could not parse
  the writer's own output back — a `ParseError` rather than the documented
  always-lossless round-trip. `_write_label` now also quotes labels
  matching these reserved `NUMBER` spellings, the same way `null`/`true`/
  `false` were already handled. (`-inf` as a label was already safe, since
  it can't start with `-` per the bare-label grammar.) (#71)

## [v0.1.3]

- New: **OML** (Omnist Markup Language) — a native, lossless codec for the
  Document model. `read_oml` / `write_oml` / `check_oml`,
  `Doc.from_oml` / `to_oml` / `check_oml`, and the `"oml"` format-registry
  entry. Every Document shape (all seven scalars, `null`, repeated and
  interleaved labels, arbitrary nesting, multiple top-level edges)
  round-trips through OML exactly — `check_oml` is always an empty
  `WriteReport`, unlike the other four formats. Supports the raw-string
  (`'…'`) and triple-quoted multiline-string (`"""…"""`) OML-Extended
  spellings on read; the canonical writer always emits OML-Core. Hardened
  against the CPython big-int-to-str DoS class (a 4300-digit limit on bare
  integers, matching `sys.get_int_max_str_digits()`'s default) and bounded
  to the Document model's own 200-level nesting depth.
- New docs: [docs/formats/oml.md](docs/formats/oml.md) (including a section
  mapping OML scalars/records onto the Python Document and builder) and
  [docs/schema.md](docs/schema.md), a standalone introduction to the Schema
  model and DSL parallel to the OML page. OML and the schema DSL are now
  promoted to first-class billing in the README, the docs index, and the
  guide, instead of being buried in format lists; the flagship examples
  (`docs/example.md`, `docs/guide.md`'s real-life example,
  `examples/canonical_model.py`) now illustrate the Document primarily in
  OML, with the other four formats shown as lossless translations.
- Fix: `infer()`'s optional-vs-required field detection was silently
  **order-dependent** — a field absent from an early sample but first seen
  in a later one could be misclassified as required (`[1,1]`) instead of
  optional (`[0,1]`), depending only on sample order. Fixed by computing
  per-sample presence in two passes (which labels exist at all, then one
  count per sample for each) instead of backfilling incrementally as
  labels were discovered.

## [v0.1.2]

Version bump only, no code or behavior changes since v0.1.1a10.

## [v0.1.1a10]

Documentation only, no code changes. Added two formal sections to
`docs/design/model.md`:

- **§11, Scalar and Python type** — a precise per-kind table of which
  Python type each scalar deserializes to, which raw values convert vs.
  raise, and how that differs from what `Schema.validate` merely checks
  (it never converts). Spells out two easy-to-miss results: `number`
  always deserializes to `float` even from an integer literal, and `bool`
  never satisfies `integer`/`number` despite being an `int` subclass.
- **§12, Inference: determining a field's Scalar from samples** — the
  exact algorithm `infer` uses: per-label kind collection, the
  integer/number collapse, the raise-on-other-mixed-kinds rule, and the
  nullable-string fallback when a field occurred but every value was
  `null` (a field that never occurs in any sample at all gets no field at
  all, which is the cardinality bookkeeping, not this algorithm).

`docs/api.md`'s `infer()` and "Schema-directed deserialization" entries
now summarize these rules and link to the formal sections instead of
leaving the Scalar↔Python-type mapping implicit.

## [v0.1.1a9]

A pre-publish review pass: no new features, but a real bug fix and a
substantial test-coverage push (89% -> 96% line coverage on `omnist/`).

- **Fixed:** `Schema(root, env)` / the `schema()` builder didn't validate
  that every environment entry is a `Record` — handing in a bare `Scalar`
  (e.g. `schema(ref("R"), R=t.string)`) crashed with a raw `AttributeError`
  from deep inside `check_refs()` instead of a clean `SchemaError`. Now
  validated up front with a clear message. (This also made a defensive
  "root must resolve to a record" check at the end of `check_refs()`
  provably unreachable dead code; removed it.)
- Closed real test gaps found while reviewing: every distinct DSL parser
  error path (missing colon, garbage top-level token, no `root`, duplicate
  definition, unquoted field label, empty cardinality, unknown reference,
  and — found while writing these — the old enum-rejection test was
  actually hitting the *tokenizer's* `|` rejection, not the parser's
  literal-type rejection, so that path was untested until now); the
  recursion-depth and cycle-detection guards `SECURITY.md` describes;
  `Doc.from_yaml`/`from_toml`/`from_xml`, `to_json`/`to_yaml`/`to_xml`,
  and `Doc == Doc`/`Doc.validate()`; malformed-input `ParseError`s for all
  four formats; the `string.ambiguous`/`null.omitted` XML adjustment codes;
  TOML's top-level-table requirement; several `compatible_with` edge cases
  (cardinality `[0,0]`, unbounded vs. bounded, a field one side doesn't
  know about); `infer()`'s zero-sample, non-object-root, mixed-type, and
  generated-name-collision cases. `dsl.py`, `document.py`, `infer.py`,
  `operations.py`, and `deserialize.py` are now at 100% line coverage.

## [v0.1.1a8]

**Breaking:** the project is renamed from `dataspec` to `omnist` ("omni-structure"),
before the first PyPI release (no users yet, so this is a clean rename, not a
deprecation period). `import dataspec` becomes `import omnist`; `DataspecError`
becomes `OmnistError`. The GitHub repository moves to
[tomlee/omnist](https://github.com/tomlee/omnist) (GitHub redirects the old
`tomlee/dataspec` URL). No behavioral changes.

## [v0.1.1a7]

Schema-directed deserialization: pass `schema=` to `read_json`/`read_yaml`/
`read_toml`/`read_xml` (and `Doc.from_json`/`from_yaml`/`from_toml`/`from_xml`)
to upgrade each leaf to match what the schema declares, when the conversion
is value-exact (`"2024-01-01" -> date`, `1.0 -> int 1`), and raise
`ParseError` when it isn't (`1.5 -> integer`, `"abc" -> integer`). Exposed
directly as `materialize(node, schema)` for already-parsed nodes. This was
the deserialization feature blocked by the value-domain ambiguity fixed in
v0.1.1a6 — every field now has exactly one candidate scalar, so there's never
a choice between candidate representations.

## [v0.1.1a6]

**Breaking:** removed value-domain composition (enums/unions) from the schema
model. A field's type is now always exactly one of the seven fixed scalars
(`string`, `integer`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`, `time`, `datetime` —
optionally nullable, e.g. `string?`) or one `Ref` to a named record — never a
composition of either. The DSL no longer has a `|` operator, literal values in
type position, or a `union`/`domain` keyword. Composable value domains made
schema-directed deserialization ambiguous: a value could satisfy more than one
candidate representation with no principled way to choose which Python type to
materialize it as, so the feature is gone rather than fixed. On the Python
builder side, the `union(...)` function is removed; a new `Scalar` class
replaces it, with ready-to-use instances exported as `STRING`, `INTEGER`,
`NUMBER`, `BOOLEAN`, `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME` (also under a `t` namespace,
e.g. `t.string`) that can be passed directly as a field's type, plus a new
`nullable(scalar)` builder for the `?` form.

## [v0.1.1a5]

**Fixed:** `datetime` accepted a bare date-only string (`"2024-01-01"`) as a
valid value, because `datetime.fromisoformat` is lenient -- it defaults a
missing time component to midnight rather than rejecting the string. That
silently treated "no time given" as "the time is exactly midnight," and
meant `date` and `datetime` weren't actually mutually exclusive for the
string form (only for real `datetime.date`/`datetime.datetime` objects).
`matches_kind` now also requires that the string does *not* parse as a bare
`date`, so `date`, `time`, and `datetime` are exclusive for every value,
string or object. Narrows acceptance -- a previously-(incorrectly-)valid
string now fails `datetime`, so this is a behavior change, not purely
additive.

## [v0.1.1a4]

Three robustness fixes for the schema DSL parser, found by probing it
against its own grammar rather than just reading it (PR 2 of the model
replan):

- **Fixed:** a non-integer cardinality bound (e.g. `[1.5,3]`) crashed with
  an uncaught `ValueError` instead of a clean `SchemaError`.
- **Fixed:** the "depth guard" counted total `{` characters across the
  *whole* schema text as a proxy for nesting depth, so a large but
  perfectly flat schema (hundreds of unrelated top-level records, no
  nesting at all) was falsely rejected. The grammar has no inline
  nesting to guard against in the first place (records are never
  anonymous), so the check is removed rather than recalibrated.
- **Fixed:** a `record` or `union` could be defined with the same name
  as a builtin scalar keyword (`record string { ... }`) with no error —
  but it could never actually be referenced, since a bare name in a type
  position always means the builtin scalar. Now raises `SchemaError` at
  definition time.

## [v0.1.1a3]

`Doc` gains `check_json` / `check_yaml` / `check_toml` / `check_xml` / a
generic `check_format`, completing the `from_*`/`to_*` symmetry the v0.1.1a2
report machinery left out — every format had a `Doc.to_*` writer, but
"simulate that write and inspect the report" required dropping down to the
module-level `check_*` function on `d.to_data()`. `Format` gains an optional
fourth field, `check`, so a plugin can support `Doc.check_format` too; the
four built-ins all provide it.

## [v0.1.1a2]

Two features deferred from the v0.1.1a1 redesign, now implemented on the
canonical model:

- **Adjustment reports + strict mode for the codecs.** Writing to a format
  that can't hold every value losslessly (TOML has no `null`; JSON/XML have
  no date type; JSON has no `NaN`/`Infinity`) is lenient by default — the
  writer adjusts the value and records it as an `Adjustment` in a
  `WriteReport` — instead of losing it silently. `write_json` / `write_yaml`
  / `write_toml` / `write_xml` (and the matching `Doc.to_*`) now accept
  `report=` to inspect what changed, and `strict=True` to raise `WriteError`
  instead of adjusting. `check_json` / `check_yaml` / `check_toml` /
  `check_xml` simulate a write and return the report with no output.
- **Format registry.** `register_format(Format(name, read, write))` adds a
  custom format usable everywhere via `Doc.from_format` / `Doc.to_format`;
  `get_format` / `formats()` look up / list what's registered. The four
  built-ins register themselves on import.

New: `omnist.canonical.report` (`WriteReport`, `Adjustment`, `finish_write`)
and `omnist.canonical.registry` (`Format`, `register_format`, `get_format`,
`formats`), both re-exported from `omnist`. Documented in
[the API reference](docs/api.md#adjustment-reports-lossy-writes) and
[the guide](docs/guide.md#reading--writing-formats); covered by new tests in
`tests/test_canonical.py` and `tests/test_docs.py`.

## [v0.1.1a1]

**A breaking redesign of the core models** around the formal Data Tree /
Schema Automaton (Lee & Cheung, CIKM 2010). The v0.1.0 API (`ObjectType`,
`ArrayType`, `obj`, `arr`, `t.*`, the `root { … }` DSL) is **removed** — this
is a clean break. See [docs/design/model.md](docs/design/model.md).

- **Document** is now an ordered list of labeled edges (a Data Tree), not a
  dict-with-arrays. "Many" is a repeated label; object and array unify; XML
  interleaving is representable. The same Document represents all four formats.
- **Schema** has two named definition kinds — **`record`** (closed fields,
  each with a cardinality) and **`union`** (a value domain of kinds, literals,
  and/or null) — referenced by name (`Ref`) for reuse and recursion. There is
  no separate array type (an array is a field with `max > 1`), no `Any`, and
  no open maps (deliberately deferred); records are closed.
- **DSL**: `record` / `union` definitions, always-quoted field labels,
  `[min,max]` cardinality, `?` for value-domain null. Operations
  (`compatible_with` / `equivalent` / `normalize`) are **methods on `Schema`**.
- The earlier `compatible_with` soundness bugs cannot recur — the open-map
  `rest` construct that caused them is gone.
- Implementation lives in `omnist.canonical`; `import omnist` is its
  public surface. Docs rewritten: a new [user guide](docs/guide.md) and the
  formal [model spec](docs/design/model.md).

## [v0.1.0a9]

Three schema-compatibility/validation soundness bugs, found by comparing
omnist's `Schema`/`Type` model against the formal Schema Automaton (SA)
model it's based on (Lee & Cheung, CIKM 2010):

- **Fixed (unsound):** `compatible_with()`/`equivalent()` judged a schema
  with an open map (`{[string]: T}` / `rest=`) "backward compatible" with a
  schema that names one of those keys explicitly with an incompatible type
  -- e.g. `{[string]: string}` was wrongly judged compatible with
  `{extra?: integer, [string]: string}`, even though `{"extra": "hello"}`
  is accepted by the former and rejected by the latter. The check only ever
  compared the two schemas' `rest` types to each other and their named
  fields to each other, never a `rest`'s emitted keys against the *other*
  schema's named fields, even though an open map can emit any key,
  including one the other side names explicitly.
- **Fixed:** an `enum` of `date`/`time`/`datetime` values was wrongly
  judged incompatible with a schema accepting that kind outright (e.g. an
  enum of two specific dates vs. a plain `date` field) -- the internal
  helper that classifies an enum literal's kind only recognized
  `bool`/`int`/`float`, silently treating every temporal value as a
  `string`.
- **Fixed (unsound):** the DSL silently dropped an enum constraint when
  mixed with a bare scalar kind in a union -- `integer | "foo"` accepted
  any string, not just `"foo"`, because the parser substituted a bare
  `string` kind for the enum instead of keeping both. The Python builder's
  `enum()` had the same latent bug from the other direction: it set the
  literals' own kind on the `ScalarType` it built, which (now that
  validation correctly falls back to checking kinds alongside an enum)
  would have made every builder-built enum accept any value of that kind,
  not just its specific literals -- caught and fixed in the same pass.
  `ScalarType`/`_check_scalar`/`_scalar_subtype`/`__repr__` now support a
  scalar kind and an enum together as a real, intentional construct rather
  than two mutually-exclusive representations.

## [v0.1.0a8]

A breaking fix to XML's document-root handling, grounded in the labeled-tree
(OEM) data model the schema design is based on: the data tree's true root is
anonymous, and an XML document element is the single *named* child of that
root, not the root itself. The previous implementation conflated the two.

- **Fixed (breaking):** `read_xml` used to discard the document element's
  tag entirely (`<x><y>1</y></x>` read as `{"y": 1}`, not `{"x": {"y": 1}}`),
  and `write_xml` always invented a meaningless `<root>` wrapper, even for
  data that already had an obvious, lossless single-element XML shape. The
  document element's tag is now a real, round-tripping top-level key:
  `read_xml`/`write_xml` work with a Document that has exactly one top-level
  key (a *single-rooted* Document) — `{"x": {"y": 1}}` <-> `<x><y>1</y></x>`,
  exactly, including a detour through another format and back.
- **New:** `read_xml_documents`/`write_xml_documents` for a Document that
  *isn't* single-rooted (multiple top-level keys, or a top-level list) —
  translates a Document <-> a *forest* of XML documents, one per top-level
  key, with a list value producing one repeated-tag document per item.
  `write_xml` itself now raises `WriteError` on a non-single-rooted Document,
  unconditionally (not just under `strict`): unlike every other lossy
  adjustment in the library, there's no value-preserving fallback shape to
  wrap it in — inventing one would mean the round-tripped data no longer
  matches the schema the original was written for.
- **Removed (breaking):** `write_xml`/`check_xml`'s `root=` and `wrap_key=`
  parameters — there's nothing left to invent a name for; the document
  element's name now always comes from the data itself.
- **Documentation:** the previously-documented "XML root-name lossiness"
  (added in v0.1.0a5) is obsolete — it was a symptom of this bug, not an
  accepted limitation — and has been rewritten across `docs/formats/xml.md`,
  `docs/document.md`, `docs/formats/overview.md`, and `docs/faq.md`.

## [v0.1.0a7]

No code changes — a packaging/release-readiness check ahead of
eventually dropping the alpha suffix and publishing.

- Verified the package actually builds and installs as a real
  artifact, not just from an editable source checkout: `python -m
  build` produces a valid sdist and wheel, `twine check` passes both,
  `py.typed` is correctly included in the wheel, and installing the
  built wheel into a clean virtualenv (no source tree on the path)
  and running the full test suite against it passes.
- Found a real blocker for publishing to PyPI under the name
  `dataspec`: an unrelated package already holds it (Covera Health's
  "Data specification and normalization toolkit," last released in
  2020). Resolving this — a different distribution name, or
  requesting release of the apparently-abandoned name — is a
  prerequisite for any PyPI publish, independent of code readiness.

## [v0.1.0a6]

Performance only — no behavior changes (verified: every existing test
passed unmodified, plus the `hypothesis` property suite at 3000
examples/property, before and after each change).

- `write_toml`/`check_toml` merged three separate full-tree passes
  (int-range scan, offset-time fix, null strip) into one. Measured
  **45% faster** on a 2000-section document (52.2ms → 28.5ms) — the
  three old passes cost almost as much as `tomli_w`'s own
  serialization.
- `Doc.to_data()` and the `get()`/`at()` snapshot helper replaced
  `copy.deepcopy` with a small Document-shape-aware copy. Measured
  **~3.5x faster** on a 2000-section document (12.9ms → 3.6ms) —
  `_snapshot()` backs every `get()`/`at()` call on a container field,
  so this is the more frequently-hit fix in practice.
- `Schema.peel()` no longer allocates an empty `set()` for the common
  case (a type that isn't a named-type reference). Measured ~11%
  faster `validate()` on a 2000-field schema with no named types
  (2.99ms → 2.67ms).

## [v0.1.0a5]

- Fixed: `write_toml`/`check_toml` crashed with a raw `ValueError` on a
  timezone-aware `time` (TOML's native `time` type has no offset slot
  at all, only `date-time` does); now stringified and reported as
  `temporal.stringified`.
- New: `integer.precision_risk` — a JSON integer beyond JavaScript's
  safe-integer range (`±2**53`) round-trips exactly through Omnist's
  own `read_json`, but silently loses precision in a JS-based parser
  (a browser, Node.js); now reported (the same class of interop risk
  as TOML's existing `integer.out_of_range` check).
- Documented: the XML root element's name is discarded on read and
  doesn't survive a detour through another format — `<k>...</k>` →
  JSON → XML gives `<root>...</root>` back, not `<k>...</k>`, unless
  you explicitly re-supply `root="k"` yourself.
- Documented: a `"How incompatibilities are handled"` overview in
  `docs/formats/overview.md` naming the three buckets every
  cross-format incompatibility falls into — raises (illegal input),
  reported adjustment (lossy-but-legal), or silent read-time
  normalization (comments, XML namespace prefixes — a short, fixed
  list with no report mechanism, since neither was ever part of the
  Document model).
- New: explicit cross-format test coverage for key names that are
  syntactically significant in one format's grammar but not another
  (TOML's `. = [ ]`, YAML's `:`, the `#` comment marker shared by
  both) — found that `.` is actually *legal inside an XML name*, so a
  TOML-special key like `"a.b"` is the one case XML does **not**
  sanitize; documented in `docs/formats/xml.md`.

## [v0.1.0a4]

A security/robustness audit of the format codecs, prompted by the
question "is the library safe now?" Found and fixed five more real
bugs, none caught by the edge-case sweep in v0.1.0a3:

- Fixed: a small, ordinary YAML payload using anchors/aliases to share
  structure (not a cycle, just YAML's normal way of avoiding
  duplication) took time **exponential** in nesting depth to validate
  — a 469-byte, 9-level payload that `yaml.safe_load` parses instantly
  didn't finish validating in 15 seconds. The cause was Omnist's own
  post-parse cycle/depth check re-walking a shared subtree once per
  alias reference instead of once per unique object; PyYAML itself
  shares the constructed objects and was never the problem. Now linear
  in the number of unique objects.
- Fixed: `read_xml` silently fell back to the standard library's XML
  parser (vulnerable to XXE/entity-expansion) with no indication at
  all when the optional `defusedxml` dependency isn't installed. Now
  raises `UnsafeXMLWarning` each time this happens.
- Fixed: `read_json`/`read_toml` leaked the underlying parser's native
  exception (`json.JSONDecodeError`, `tomllib.TOMLDecodeError`) on
  malformed input instead of wrapping it in `ParseError` like
  `read_yaml`/`read_xml` already did, breaking the documented
  "catch everything with `except ParseError`" contract.
- Fixed: `write_xml` embedded literal control characters (e.g. a NUL
  byte) directly in the output with no warning — unlike the format's
  other adjustments, this isn't lossy, the result doesn't parse as XML
  *at all*. Now stripped and reported as `string.illegal_xml_char`,
  an error.
- Fixed: `infer()` crashed with a raw `AttributeError`/`TypeError` on a
  sample like `[False, {}]`, instead of the same clean, documented
  `SchemaError` every other "mix of structure and scalar" sample
  already got. A bool was classified separately from other scalars in
  the structural-mixing check; now it isn't.
- New: `tests/test_property.py` — property-based fuzzing with
  `hypothesis`, generating randomized Documents and text across every
  codec and the DSL parser on every CI run. Found three of the five
  bugs above.
- New: `SECURITY.md` — the trust model for each format (what's
  hardened, what isn't) and how to report a vulnerability (GitHub
  private vulnerability reporting, now enabled on this repo).

## [v0.1.0a3]

- Fixed: deeply/adversarially nested input (`Doc` construction, the
  functional `write_*`/`read_*` codecs, and the schema DSL parser) used
  to crash with an uncatchable `RecursionError`; each now raises a clean
  `DocumentError`/`SchemaError` past a depth limit.
- Fixed: a real key collision (e.g. JSON's `{1: "a", "1": "b"}`, or two
  XML keys sanitizing to the same element name) was reported as a soft
  warning even though it silently overwrites one value with the other;
  now reported as `key.collision`, an **error**.
- Fixed: the format registry (`register_format`/`get_format`/`formats()`)
  was an unsynchronized global dict; a plugin registered from a
  background thread could race a concurrent lookup. Now thread-safe.
- Fixed: three more silent XML/TOML data-corruption cases found by a
  systematic edge-case sweep — a string that looks like a number/bool/
  `null` silently changing type on read (`string.ambiguous`), an empty
  object/array silently becoming an empty string or vanishing entirely
  (`container.empty.ambiguous`), an integer beyond TOML's signed 64-bit
  range written without warning (`integer.out_of_range`), and a string
  containing `\r` silently losing its line endings per the XML spec's
  own normalization rules (`string.line_ending_normalized`). All four
  are now reported, and rejected by `strict=True`.
- New: `tests/edge_cases.py` / `tests/test_edge_cases.py` — a shared
  corpus of ~45 edge-case values swept across every format and a few
  API operations (`Doc`, `infer`, DSL round-trip) via general
  invariants rather than hand-coded expectations per case.
- New: `tests/test_dsl.py` negative-path coverage — one case per
  distinct `SchemaError` the hand-written DSL parser can raise.
- CI now runs `ruff check .` and every `examples/*.py` script, not just
  `pytest`.
- New: `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Removed the redundant `sys.path.insert` boilerplate from every
  example and test file (the editable install already covers it); a
  few `pyproject.toml` metadata fields filled in.

## [v0.1.0a2]

- New: `finish_write(text, rep, *, strict=False, report=None)`, a public
  helper format plugins can call instead of reimplementing the
  strict/report decision every built-in writer makes; the built-ins
  (`write_json`/`write_yaml`/`write_toml`/`write_xml`) now use it too.
- New: [`docs/plugins.md`](docs/plugins.md) — a guide for writing a format
  plugin (the `Format` contract, the adjustment-report pattern, a
  verified worked example, testing, and a checklist).
- Project practices: `CHANGELOG.md`, `ruff` lint config, a `py.typed`
  marker (PEP 561), and branch protection on `master` requiring CI.
- Changes from here on go through a pull request rather than a direct
  commit to `master`.
- Docs: example city/coordinates data changed from Hong Kong to London
  (and Shenzhen to Dublin); assorted doc-accuracy fixes found during a
  full pass over the doc set (stale TOML array-formatting comments, a
  missing validation error, clarified empty-array inference).

## [v0.1.0a1] - first tagged alpha

- Core model: `Doc` (the guarded data-DOM) and the `Schema`/`Type` tree
  (`ScalarType`, `ArrayType`, `ObjectType`, `AnyType`, `RefType`).
- Schema DSL: `parse_schema` / `to_dsl`, plus a Python schema builder
  (`obj`, `arr`, `mapping`, `enum`, `optional`, `nullable`, `ref`, `schema`,
  and the `t` namespace for scalar atoms).
- Pluggable format registry with built-in JSON, YAML, TOML, and XML codecs
  (`read_*` / `write_*` / `check_*`), lenient by default with adjustment
  reporting (`WriteReport` / `Adjustment`) and an opt-in `strict` mode.
- `infer()` to draft a schema from example Documents.
- Schema comparison operations: `compatible_with`, `equivalent`, `normalize`.
- Full exception hierarchy under `OmnistError`.
- GitHub Actions CI running the test suite (228 tests) on Python 3.11–3.13.
- Complete documentation set: concepts, architecture, getting started, the
  `Doc` API, the schema language, format-by-format pages, inference, schema
  comparison, an API reference, and an FAQ — every code example verified
  against the library.
