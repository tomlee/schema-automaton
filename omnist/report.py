"""Adjustment reports for lossy writes.

Writing a Document to a format that can't hold every value (TOML has no
``null``; JSON/XML have no date type) means the writer has to *adjust* the data.
Each adjustment is recorded as an :class:`Adjustment` in a :class:`WriteReport`
rather than lost silently.  The same report drives three behaviours:

* **lenient** (default) — adjust and move on; ignore the report if you like.
* **inspect** — pass ``report=`` to a writer (or call ``check_*``) to see what
  changed without stopping.
* **strict** — ``strict=True`` raises :class:`~omnist.errors.WriteError`
  (carrying the report) if anything had to be adjusted.

Each adjustment has a ``severity``: ``"warning"`` (conventional / recoverable —
a date written as a string) or ``"error"`` (likely to surprise or corrupt — a
``null`` dropped, ``NaN`` in JSON).  ``strict`` ignores severity and raises on
anything.
