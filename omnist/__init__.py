"""omnist — one canonical data model, many formats.

A **Document** is a *tree*: an ordered list of labeled edges (repeated
labels are how arrays appear), held by a :class:`Doc`.  A **Schema** describes
the shape a Document may have, as ``record`` definitions referenced by name.
A field's value side is always exactly one of the seven scalars (``string``,
``integer``, ``number``, ``boolean``, ``date``, ``time``, ``datetime``),
optionally nullable, or a reference to a named record — never a composed
value-domain (no enums, no literal-valued fields). Read a format into a
``Doc``, validate it against a ``Schema``, and write it back to any format.

    from omnist import parse_schema, doc

    s = parse_schema('''
        record Member { "name": string, "role": string }
        record Team   { "name": string, "members" [1,]: Member }
        root Team
    ''')
    s.validate(doc({"name": "X", "members": [{"name": "Ann", "role": "dev"}]})).ok

The model is defined formally in ``docs/design/model.md``; this package is
its implementation, and this module is its public surface.
