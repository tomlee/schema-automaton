"""Schema minimization: partition-refinement to the canonical minimal form.

Implements the paper's Algorithm 2 (MinimizeSA) -- the same family as DFA
minimization by partition refinement (Hopcroft/Moore-style state merging).
``normalize(s)`` returns an equivalent schema with the *fewest possible*
env records, unique up to record naming (paper Theorems 3-4; they transfer
to omnist's deterministic counting-language restriction -- see
``docs/design/model.md``).

Algorithm:

1. ``s = prune(s)`` -- mandatory first step. Two semantically-equal records
   must not be kept apart by never-emittable fields or unreachable
   records; pruning first is what makes the partition canonical (see
   ``ops/prune.py``).
2. **Initial partition**: env records grouped by ``local_signature`` (see
   ``ops/signature.py``) -- a target-blind structural key, so records that
   might turn out equivalent via differently-named ref targets still start
   in the same block.
3. **Refine**: split any block whose members disagree, for some label,
   on which *block* their same-labeled ref-typed field points to. Repeat
   until no block splits (a fixpoint -- always reached on a finite env).
   This is exactly DFA-minimization-style refinement: two states are
   equivalent iff every transition leads to equivalent states.
4. **Merge**: collapse each stable block to a single representative --
   its lexicographically smallest member name (deterministic) -- and
   remap every ref and the root to representatives.

Special case: an unsatisfiable (empty-language) root. ``prune()``
deliberately leaves such a root's fields untouched (see its docstring),
so partition refinement over the unsatisfiable core isn't meaningful --
there's no "fewest records" notion to compute when the schema accepts no
finite document at all. In that case ``normalize`` just returns the
pruned schema unchanged.
