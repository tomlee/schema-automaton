"""Satisfiability analysis and schema pruning.

Implements the paper's "useless-state removal" (MakeUsefulSA) analog: a
record is *satisfiable* iff it admits at least one finite document, and
:func:`prune` returns an equivalent schema with everything that can never
match removed. This is the precondition Algorithm 4 (SubschemaSA,
``ops/subschema.py``) needs to be correct — see ``docs/design/model.md``
for the full satisfiability subsection.

Satisfiability is a least fixpoint over the env's records: a record is
satisfiable iff every field with ``min >= 1`` is either a ``Scalar`` or a
``Ref`` to a satisfiable record. (Fields with ``min == 0`` never block
satisfiability -- they simply need not be emitted.) Scalars are always
satisfiable, so a record with no mandatory fields at all is trivially
satisfiable (the empty document for that record admits it).

      are dropped (they could never actually be emitted either);
    * records left unreachable/unsatisfiable after the above are dropped
      from the environment too.

    **Root-unsatisfiable case.** If the root record itself is unsatisfiable
    (every finite document is rejected -- ``is_empty()`` is True), field
    pruning is *not* applied to the root: its mandatory fields are exactly
    what make it unsatisfiable, and stripping them would silently produce a
    *different*, satisfiable schema, contradicting "prune returns an
    equivalent schema." Instead the root record is kept as-is and only the
    rest of the environment is reduced to what's reachable from it (which,
    being unsatisfiable, typically collapses to the cyclic core itself).

    MakeUsefulSA modifies the automaton rather than rejecting it outright.
