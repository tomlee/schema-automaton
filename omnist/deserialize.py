"""Schema-directed deserialization: make a freshly-read node conform to a
:class:`~omnist.schema.Schema`, or raise.

Readers (``read_json``, etc.) hand back text-shaped values: JSON/YAML/TOML
have no ``date``/``time`` type, so a temporal field arrives as an ISO-8601
string; a whole-number ``float`` may need to become an ``int`` (or vice
versa) to match what the schema declares. Passing ``schema=`` to a reader is
the request for a Document that's *guaranteed* to conform to that schema:
:func:`materialize` walks the node together with the schema, upgrading each
leaf **only when the conversion is value-exact** -- ``"2024-01-01" -> date``,
``1.0 -> int 1`` -- and checking every record's shape (closed fields,
cardinality) along the way, exactly as :meth:`Schema.validate` would. If
anything can't be made to conform -- an inexact scalar, an unknown field, a
missing field, the wrong cardinality -- :func:`materialize` collects *every*
such problem (not just the first) and raises one
:class:`~omnist.errors.ParseError` with the full report.

This can't simply delegate to :meth:`Schema.validate` after the fact:
``validate`` only ever *checks* a value already in its final form, with no
notion of upgrading, and it would mean a second, redundant top-down walk of
the same tree using different traversal code. Since :func:`materialize`
already knows, at every node, exactly which field/type the schema expects
there, upgrading and shape-checking happen together in one pass.

There's no ``strict=`` switch: a schema is either given, in which case the
result is guaranteed to conform (or an error is raised), or it isn't, in
which case the node is returned exactly as read, untouched -- ``schema=None``
is the existing, well-defined way to opt out of validation entirely.
