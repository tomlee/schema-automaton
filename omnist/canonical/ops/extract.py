"""Subschema extraction (paper Algorithm 5, ExtractSubschema).

Given a schema and a set of *permissible labels* ``keep`` (the paper's
``X'``), produces the minimal subschema that recognizes only documents built
from those labels -- the headline application in the paper is trimming a
large shared schema (xCBL) down to just what a single document type needs
(reported there as a 6-32% size reduction).

Algorithm:

1. For every record in the env, delete any field whose label is not in
   ``keep``.
2. If a deleted field had ``min >= 1`` (mandatory), that record is
   *invalidated* -- the paper's "state removed": there is no way to build a
   document at that record's shape without a label that's no longer
   available, so the record itself can no longer be produced.
3. **Propagate.** A record with a *mandatory* field whose type is an
   invalidated record is itself invalidated (that field can never be
   filled), and so on transitively -- a least-fixpoint closure, same shape
   as ``ops/prune.py``'s satisfiability fixpoint.
4. If the root ends up invalidated, there is no valid subschema for this
   ``keep`` set at all: :func:`extract` raises :class:`~omnist.SchemaError`
   naming the first offending label and record, so the failure is
   actionable.
5. Otherwise, invalidated records (and fields typed to them, along with any
   fields already dropped in step 1) are gone; the result is run through
   :func:`~omnist.canonical.ops.prune.prune` and
   :func:`~omnist.canonical.ops.minimize.normalize` (Algorithm 5's own
   final MakeUseful + Minimize step) to land in the same canonical minimal
   form ``normalize()`` produces elsewhere.

**Design decision: mandatory deletion is an error, not silently-optional.**
An alternative design could relax a deleted mandatory field to optional
instead of invalidating its record. This implementation deliberately does
not do that: silently loosening cardinality would mean `extract`'s result
no longer reflects the paper's Algorithm 5 semantics (which reports "no
valid subschema" rather than inventing a weaker one), and it would hide a
likely mistake -- asking to keep a leaf label without any of the mandatory
structure that leads to it is far more often a bug in the caller's `keep`
set than an intentional relaxation. Callers who do want the relaxed
behavior can trivially get it by editing field cardinalities before calling
`extract`.
