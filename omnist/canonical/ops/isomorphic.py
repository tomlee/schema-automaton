"""Schema isomorphism -- the paper's Algorithm 3, step 3.

Theorem 4 (the paper): two schemas are equivalent iff their minimized
(normalized) forms are isomorphic. That gives a second, algorithm-
independent decision procedure for ``equivalent`` -- structurally unrelated
to bidirectional ``compatible_with`` (``ops/subschema.py``), so the two can
be cross-checked against each other in tests (see ``docs/testing.md``,
"the dual-algorithm oracle").

``_isomorphic`` is intentionally private and not re-exported from
``omnist``/``omnist.canonical``: the public API commits to ``equivalent``
(the cheaper, single algorithm) staying the definition of schema equality.
This module exists purely as an independent oracle for property tests.

Algorithm: parallel traversal from both roots, building a bijection
``name_a -> name_b`` (and its inverse) between env record names as the
traversal discovers pairs. At each visited record pair, ``local_signature``
must match (same target-blind shape); since ``local_signature`` sorts
fields by label and ref/scalar shape is part of the key, fields on the two
sides line up one-to-one by label once the signatures agree. For each
ref-typed field, the two targets are recursively required to be
isomorphic, with the bijection enforced consistently in both directions:
if a name has already been mapped, revisiting it must reach the same
partner every time (and vice versa) -- exactly the DFA-isomorphism check
partition refinement's minimal form is built to make trivial: after
``normalize()``, any structural match between two records has to be a
consistent renaming, not a coincidence, since minimize has already merged
every pair of records that could otherwise masquerade as "the same
record under a different name."

Both inputs are assumed already normalized (pruned + minimized) by the
caller -- this module does not call ``normalize`` itself, matching the
paper's Algorithm 3, which runs isomorphism testing as a step *after*
MinimizeSA, not as a self-contained schema comparison.
