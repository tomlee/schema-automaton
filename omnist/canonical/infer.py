"""Infer a Schema from example Documents, on the canonical model.

Given one or more sample Documents, draft a ``record`` schema that accepts
them:

* a label present in every sample with count 1 becomes a required field
  (``[1,1]``); absent in some samples -> ``[0,1]``; seen more than once ->
  an array (``[min,]``);
* scalar children become one :class:`~omnist.canonical.schema.Scalar`
  (nullable if any sample was null). Samples disagreeing on scalar shape
  raise, except ``integer``/``number`` mixing, which collapses to
  ``number`` (the one subset relation between scalars) -- see
  ``docs/design/model.md``;
* object children become a nested, named ``record`` (recursively).

Since the model has no inline records, nested records are given generated
names derived from their label.  ``normalize`` afterwards merges any that turn
out structurally identical.
