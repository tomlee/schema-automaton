"""Brute-force semantic oracle for the schema algebra (issue #158, PR-4 of
the #154 review's execution plan).

Checks every schema-algebra operation against **set-theoretic ground
truth** -- the actual language ``L(s) = {d in U : s.validate(Doc(d)).ok}``
of a schema ``s`` over a finite, enumerated universe ``U`` of documents --
rather than against another algorithm. This is a *third*, independent
check: ``compatible_with`` (paper Algorithm 4, ``omnist/ops/subschema.py``)
and the minimize+isomorphism Theorem-4 oracle (``omnist/ops/isomorphic.py``,
cross-checked in ``tests/test_fuzz.py``) are two algorithms that could both
share the same conceptual bug; brute-force enumeration against ``validate()``
itself cannot, since ``validate()`` is the ground truth definition of a
schema's language in the first place.

Originates from the full-codebase review in issue #154 (D2): "the review's
strongest tool should live in the repo."

Usage::

    python3 tools/semantic_oracle.py

Exits 1 (and prints every definite bug found) if any check fails in a way
that proves a real algebra bug; exits 0 otherwise, having printed the
summary counts (universe size, schema count, pairs checked, vindication
breakdown, extract cases).

**Deliberate universe-sizing deviation from the #154 review.** The
review's own run enumerated 8,557 (base) / 13,093 (extended) documents.
This script's universe -- built from the same description (root edge-lists
over labels ``{a, b}``, leaves ``{1, "x", None}``, children leaf or
depth-1, extended shapes witnessing cardinality up to 4) -- lands at
different exact counts (see ``build_universe()``\\'s docstring) because the
review's own enumeration code was not available to reproduce verbatim;
this is a fresh, independently-derived construction from the review's
prose. Both land in the same order of magnitude and exercise the same
shape space; see the PR description for the actual counts and wall time
from a run of this script (measured around ~110s on a modest dev machine
-- somewhat over the review's original "~1-2 min" framing but still in the
same ballpark; the dominant cost is ``normalize``/``prune``/``extract``
each re-validating the full document universe per schema, which is
inherent to brute-force ground-truth checking at this universe size).
